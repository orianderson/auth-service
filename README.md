# Multi-Purpose Authentication and Authorization Microservice

This authentication and authorization service aims to provide a clear, objective, robust, and secure alternative to the challenges of unauthorized access. Continuous updates will be implemented to keep up with technological advancements regarding application security.

## üîê Security Architecture for Authentication Microservice

### 1. Core Technologies

- **Language**:

  - NestJS with TypeScript (robust ecosystem)

- **Security Frameworks**:
  - Passport.js

### 2. Authentication Strategies

#### Login

- Implement:
  - Strong credential validation
  - Limit on login attempts
  - Temporary lockout after multiple failures

#### Data Protection

- **Password Encryption**:
  - Bcrypt (salt + hash)
  - Work factor: minimum 12

#### JWT Tokens

- Configurations:
  - Signed with asymmetric RSA keys
  - Short duration (15-30 minutes)
  - Refresh tokens with rotation
  - Minimum necessary claims

### 3. Protections Against Vulnerabilities

#### Against Attacks

- **CSRF**:

  - Synced tokens
  - SameSite cookies
  - Double Submit Cookie

- **XSS**:

  - Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - Input sanitization
  - Escape dynamic content

- **SQL Injection**:
  - ORM with prepared statements
  - Schema validation
  - Principle of least privilege in the database

#### Logging and Auditing

- Masking of sensitive data
- Structured logs
- Do not log passwords/tokens
- Integration with monitoring systems

### 4. Multi-Factor Authentication

#### OTP via Email

- Libraries:
  - `speakeasy` (token generation)
  - `nodemailer` (sending)
- Configurations:
  - Tokens of 6-8 digits
  - Short expiration (5-10 minutes)
  - Limit on attempts

### 5. Prevention Against Bots

#### Challenges

- reCAPTCHA v3

### 6. Password Recovery

#### Secure Flow

- Unique reset tokens
- Expiration of 1 hour
- Sending via encrypted email
- History of old passwords

### 7. Logout and Session Management

#### Strategies

- Invalidating tokens on the backend
- Blacklist of revoked tokens
- Remote logout on multiple devices
- Active session logging

### 8. Infrastructure

#### Components

- Vault (secret management)
- Nginx as reverse proxy
- WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- Monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana

### 9. Additional Best Practices

- Constant updates
- Periodic penetration testing
- Code reviews
- Principle of least privilege

### 10. Final Considerations

‚úÖ **Critical Points**:

- Security is not a product, it is a process
- Continuous maintenance
- Security culture

‚ùó **Final Recommendation**:
Implement in layers, with rigorous testing and constant reviews.
